Flex\+Box is a flexible M\+A\+T\+L\+AB toolbox for finite dimensional convex variational problems in image processing and beyond. Such problems often consist of non-\/differentiable parts and involve linear operators. The toolbox uses a primal-\/dual scheme to avoid (computationally) inefficient operator inversion and to get reliable error estimates. From the user-\/side, Flex\+Box expects the primal formulation of the problem, automatically decouples operators and dualizes the problem. For large-\/scale problems, Flex\+Box also comes with a C++ modulke, which can be used stand-\/alone or together with M\+A\+T\+L\+AB via M\+E\+X-\/interfaces. Besides various pre-\/implemented data-\/fidelities and regularization-\/terms, Flex\+Box is able to handle arbitrary operators while being easily extendable, due to its object-\/oriented design. The toolbox is available at \href{http://www.flexbox.im}{\tt http\+://www.\+flexbox.\+im}

Nowadays, many problems in image processing consist of minimizing convex energies. Typically these problems can be written as $\min_{x} F(Ax)$
